readme:
    the PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) is a hardware timer used in x86 computers
    it is used to generate interrupts at regular intervals
    it is used by the operating system to keep track of time and to schedule tasks
    it is also used to implement functions like sleep() and delay()
    the PIT operates at a base frequency of 1.193182 MHz (1193182 Hz)
    by setting a divisor value, the PIT can be configured to generate interrupts at a lower frequency

#define PIT_FREQUENCY 1193182 // Hz
#define PIT_TICKS_PER_MS 1193 // For approximately 1ms sleep

#define PIT_COMMAND_PORT 0x43 // write-only

PIT outputs
Channel 0 is connected directly to IRQ0, so it is best to use it only for purposes that should generate interrupts. 
Channel 1 is unusable, and may not even exist. 
Channel 2 is connected to the PC speaker, but can be used for other purposes without producing audible speaker tones.
